Apart from TV's absense over the last few weeks there have also been a distinct lack of games. The games industry is the worst offender for neglecting summer even when a large number of their customers are on their holidays looking for something to burn time on.

At the start of this summer it was a great oppertunity for me to catch up on some of things I missed over the last year. I nailed Oblivion, spent too much time with Civ4, finished Halo 2 at last and got back into Guitar Hero (expert mode baby!) after a long time away. All those weeks ago I didn't think I would run out of things to play but I have and it's very weird feeling after being so behind all year.

One look towards the Christmas schedule reveals a mass of games waiting to be played but all coming out within weeks of each other. Lets see what kind of ridiculous list I can come up with:

<ul>
	<li>Lego Star Wars 2</li>
	<li>Just Cause</li>
	<li>Company of Heroes</li>
	<li>Splinter Cell: Double Agent</li>
	<li>Dawn of War: Dark Crusade</li>
	<li>Gears of War</li>
	<li>Neverwinter Nights 2</li>
</ul>

Ouch!
