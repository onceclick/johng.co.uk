People have been asking so here it is.

Watched the <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/j47d52oo/event/">keynote</a> last night. Love the <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Apple_iPhone__6610317">iPhone</a> and I definitely want one. It's far and away the best UI I have seen on a phone and it must terrify their new rivals. I could go on and on about how good it is but instead here are a few of my initial concerns:

<ul>
	<li>UK pricing. If I sign up to a 12 month contract I am used to getting discounted phones. Can't see that happening.</li>
	<li>Storage. This is the widescreen, touch screen iPod we have been waiting for but there will not be enough space for all our music and a collection of movies.</li>
	<li>Openness. Can I install my own software? It doesn't look that way, strange really - if Apple threw us some APIs for that touch screen we'd have a DS rival on our hands in no time.</li>
	<li>Scratchability (look it up kids). Big screen = big scratches. I smell third party love.</li>
	<li>Wireless sync. It's got WiFi. The Apple TV can sync via WiFi so why can't this?</li>
</ul>

So there you have it. It would be nice to see these issues addressed soon but we are a long way from launch and as we get closer I'm sure we shall hear more.
