Getting this error like this when you deploy your Ruby on Rails app to a production server?

You probably need to upgrade the server to Ruby 1.8.7 like me :) Doh! LuckilyÂ <a href="http://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine/commit/41eb65a37c3781b2e28d8434f95f1a1165c358b4">moonshine</a> has it covered for this one, I just had to switch from using ree to ree187 in my moonshine.yml file.
