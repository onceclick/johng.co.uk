... but can't due to exams and a certain disertation. All these are out or will be during my uni crunch time. Dammit!

<ul>
	<li>Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion - Holy moly I need to play this, collectors edition on its way</li>
	<li>Civilization IV - Was out last year but I still don't think I have spent enough time with it.</li>
	<li>Ghost Recon: AWF - Looks fantastico</li>
	<li>The Movies - Still waiting on that one</li>
	<li>Galactic Civilizations 2 - Civ in space!</li>
	<li>Half Life 2: Episode 1 - Nuff said</li>
	<li>Sin Episodes: Emergence - More episodic source engine goodness</li>
	<li>Space Rangers - because Kieron Gillen keeps banging on about it</li>
</ul>

That's a big pile to get through. Unfortunately they are going to have to wait till mid May when my final year wraps up. I just hope nothing else huge comes out between now and then.
