You can tell the new TV season is officially apon us when there is far too much to watch. Take all the new stuff on last night for example:

<ul>
	<li>Family Guy</li>
	<li>American Dad</li>
	<li>Rome</li>
	<li>TNA: Unbreakable</li>
	<li>Simpsons</li>
</ul>

In a few weeks Curb Your Enthusiasm is back so you can add that to the list. Obviously TNA is a one off but it seems like every week there is a good PPV on whether it's WWE, TNA, UFC or Pride.

It's just finding the time (and the bandwidth).
