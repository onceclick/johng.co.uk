The <a href="http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2009/7/29/968573/report-what-the-ufc-offered-fedor">offer</a> UFC made to Fedor today was ridiculous:

<ul>
	<li>6 fight contract worth $30 million</li>
	<li>an immediate title shot</li>
	<li>a cut of the Lesnar/Fedor PPV going directly to M-1</li>
	<li>Fedor was free to wear as many items with the M-1 logo as he wished</li>
	<li>allowing Fedor to compete in combat Sambo</li>
</ul>

If co-promotion is the sticking point then they are just even more stupid than we all realised last time this went down.Â The only thing M-1 don't get are their logos on the event and overseas footage rights. UFC are giving them a cut of the PPV and logos on Fedor. It's so close to co-promotion it may aswell be called that and it's so much more than anyone has offered them they are nuts to reject it. Hell he's even in the EA game now!

A bunch of extremely minor technicalities and semantics are preventing this deal from happening. Crazy Russians indeed.
